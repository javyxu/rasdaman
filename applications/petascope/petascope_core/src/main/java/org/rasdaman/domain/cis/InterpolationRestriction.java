/**
 * 6.5.3 (CIS 1.1) Constraints on the interpolation methods meaningfully
 * applicable to this coverage
 *
 * If no interpolationRestriction element is present (null), then any interpolation
 * method is applicable to the coverage on hand.
 *
 * In presence of an interpolationRestriction element, only those interpola-
 * tion methods may be meaningfully applied whose identifiers appear in an
 * allow- edInterpolation element; 
 * 
 * in case of an empty list this means that no interpolation is applicable at all.
