/**
 * CIS 1.1

 * The optional CIS::Envelope component helps applications in gaining a quick overview
on the coverageâ€™s location. The location information does not need to use the same CRS as
the domain set, therefore the bounding box may not always be the minimal.
* 
*  If present, the envelope of a coverage instantiating class coverage shall consist of a
CIS::EnvelopeByAxis which contains list of AxisExtent.
