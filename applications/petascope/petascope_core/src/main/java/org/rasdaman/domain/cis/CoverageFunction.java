/**
 *
 * CIS 1.1
 *
 *
 * Optional (zero or One)
 *
 * The coverageFunction component is identical in its syntax and meaning to the
 * corresponding element defined in GML 3.2.1 [2] Subclause 19.3.11. It
 * describes the mapping function from the domain to the range of the coverage.
 * For a grid coverage, it specifies the serialization of the multi-dimensional
 * grid in the range set.
 *
 * Note 1: This becomes particularly relevant when defining encoding formats,
 * such as GML or JSON. Note 2: For the readerâ€™s convenience, the default is
 * copied from GML 3.2.1: If the gml:coverageFunction property is omitted for a
 * gridded coverage (including rectified gridded coverages) the gml:startPoint
 * is assumed to be the value of the gml:low property in the gml:Grid geometry,
 * and the gml:sequenceRule is assumed to be linear and the gml:axisOrder
 * property is assumed to be "+1 +2"
 *
 *
 * Clearer definition is in: http://www.rasdaman.org/wiki/PetascopeSubsets
