 * DomainSet describing the coverage’s domain and a rangeSet component
 * containing the range values (“pixels”, “voxels”) of the coverage.
 *
 * A coverage contains a domainSet component describing the coverage’s domain
 * (the set of “direct positions”, i.e., the locations for which values are
 * stored in the coverage).
 *
 * The domain set is defined through an ordered list of axes whose lower and
 * upper bounds establish the extent along each axis (extracted from CRS
 * reference group).
 *
 * Each of coverage type (GeneralGridCoverage, MultiPointCoverage,
 * MultiCurveCoverage, MultiSurfaceCoverage, MultiSolidCoverage) has different
 * DomainSet.
