/**
 * CIS 1.1
 * 
 * Axis type CIS::RegularAxis has no restriction on the CRS used; as it is regularly spaced
it contains the common distance, i.e.: resolution, as a part of the axis definition.
* 
* Note: The type is string to accommodate any potential resolution specification, such as “100” for
degrees or meters, “2015-07-30T23Z” for a 1-hour duration in Gregorian calendar, and potential future
calendar types.
* 
* In a coverage using the grid-regular scheme, the resolution value in a
CIS::RegularAxis shall be a nonzero, *positive* value expressed in the units of measure of
this axis as defined in the CRS identified in the srsName item of the envelope.
* 
* The positive integer number of direct position coordinates along regular axis:
* 
* gridPoints = Math.floor( (gridUpperbound - gridLowerBound + 1) / resolution)
*
