/**
 * CIS 1.1
 *
 * Except for an index axis (which is a bare array grid), coordinates in an axis
 * are expressed in some geodetic CRS or similar. Correspondingly, the grid
 * limits in the CIS::Axis structure contains information about the grid
 * boundaries in the coverageâ€™s CRS.
 *
 * In addition, the limits of the underlying array are given by the
 * CIS::gridLimits component. This structure is optional because it is not
 * needed when all coverage axes are of type CIS::indexAxis , in which case the
 * boundary information is redundant.
