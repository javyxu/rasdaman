This directory contains gRPC Java Codegen Plugin for Protobuf Compiler from
https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/tree/master/compiler/src/java_plugin/cpp
(commit 6f9b4e87e16192b870cc13bd2d48f4db187d2308).
The license is BSD-3: https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/master/LICENSE

The reason we do this manually with our own Makefile is because building with 
the official gradle build script doesn't work with Java 7.
