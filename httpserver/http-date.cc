/****** http-date/HTTP_Date **************************************************
*
*   NAME
*       HTTP_Date -- create a HTTP date string.
*
*   SYNOPSIS
*       rc_t HTTP_Date( char *Buffer, size_t BuffSize );
*
*   FUNCTION
*       Creates a date (and time) string as defined in the HTTP
*       specifications. It uses the `gmtime()' system function to get the
*       current time in Greenwich Mean Time and creates a date string with
*       the help of `strftime()'.
*
*   INPUTS
*       Buffer - a pointer to a buffer for the new string.
*       BuffSize - size of the Buffer for the date string.
*
*   RESULT
*       Returns the "OK" status code if it succesfully created the date
*       string, "ERROR" otherwise. The only reason for this function should
*       fail, is when the Buffer is not large enough.
*       As a side effect, if the function succeeds, Buffer will contain the
*       current time and date in a format conforming to the HTTP
*       specifications.
*
*   BUGS
*       Does not check if Buffer is NULL-pointer.
*
*   SEE ALSO
*       RFC 2068: Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1
