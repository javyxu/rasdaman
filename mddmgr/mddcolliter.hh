/*@Doc:
    A MDDCollIter represents an iterator for a persistent MDD collection.
    If a collection is changed (elements are removed or added to/from the
    collection) between creation of an iterator for it and the execution of
    other operations on the iterator, the behavior of the istent Iterator
    is undefined.
    The {\tt MDDColl::createIterator()} for the object to be scanned should
    be used to create a new iterator object.
