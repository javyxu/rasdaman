/*@Doc:

QtOperation defines a method {\tt evaluate()} getting a tuple of {\tt QtData} and returning
a {\tt QtData} element. Every subclass has to redefine this method to compute its specific
operation. Therefore, it takes its inputs which are also of type {\tt QtOperation}, and
invokes the {\tt evaluate()} method again. The results are used as operands and the
computed value is returned.
