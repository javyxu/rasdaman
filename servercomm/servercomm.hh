/*@Doc:
  The class servercomm describes the one and only server communication object
  that can exist in a RasDaMan RPC server. It manages listening for client and
  maps incoming calls to the respective remote procedures (which reside in the
  file manager.cc). These remote procedures are global functions
  which mainly concern with RPC call processing and finally call the methods
  of this servercomm class to forward client requests.

      Returns a pointer to the context of the calling client. This is done by
      searching the client table maintained by the server for the given client id.
      If there is no context corresponding to the client id, 0 is returned.

      Attention: After a client context was successfully received it has to be
                 released using its member function release();
