/*@Doc:
  The class CallBackManager stores function- and context pointers
  that are executed in the order they were registered in when
  calling executePending(). This system replaces the alarm handler
  approach formerly used which suffered from a restrictive
  environment where mallocs and printfs were not legal. Since
  neither call must happen when a callback function is registered
  the maximum number of callbacks must be fixed in the constructor.
